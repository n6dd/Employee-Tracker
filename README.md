# Employee-Tracker

## Description

This application was made to be able to keep up to date with all of your employees. This includes seeing who they're manager is, salary, what department their in and more! You can change and update any if this information at your fingertips.

## Installation

You will need VS Code and Git Bash. Along with those you will need some dependencies including dontenv, inquirer and pg. You will also need some dev dependencies including node, typescript and a few others. You can run "npm install" under the package.json to get everything you need to run the application installed. After all dependencies are installed you can run "npm run start" to start the application. 

## Usage

You will have a few options that you can choose from using the arrow keys on your keyboard. In the example video [here]([https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/home](https://github.com/n6dd/Employee-Tracker)), I have the tables already pre-populated with random people but you can also start from scratch using the add options.
